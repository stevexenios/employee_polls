# Home Component

## Requirements

- [X] The application should have a leaderboard that’s available at the /leaderboard route.
- [X] Each entry on the leaderboard should contain the following:

1. User’s name;
2. User’s picture;
3. Number of questions the user asked; and
4. Number of questions the user answered

- [X] Users should be ordered in descending order based on the sum of the number of questions they’ve asked and the number of questions they’ve answered. The more questions you ask and answer, the higher up you move.

- [X] The user should be able to navigate to the leaderboard, to a specific question, and to the form that allows the user to create a new poll both from within the app and by typing in the address into the address bar. To make sure we’re showing the data that is relevant to the user, the application should require the user to be signed in order to access those pages.
