# Question Details Component

## Requirements
- [X] If someone tries to navigate anywhere by entering the address in the address bar, the user is asked to sign in and then the requested page is shown. 
- [X] Each polling question should link to the details of that poll. The details of each poll should be available at questions/:question_id.
- [X] Since we want to make sure our application creates a good user experience, the application should show a 404 page if the user is trying to access a poll that does not exist. (Please keep in mind that newly created polls will not be accessible at their url because of the way the backend is set up in this application.)
